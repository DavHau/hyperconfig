# Local patch (2026-09-20, not upstream as of that date): the injected
# Claude Code identity block used to hardcode cache_control ttl=1h. Anthropic
# rejects a ttl=1h block placed after a ttl=5m block (order: tools, system,
# messages), and hermes marks tools[-1]/messages with prompt_caching.cache_ttl
# (default 5m), so every request 400ed unless the user set cache_ttl: 1h.
# _identity_cache_control() now mirrors the tier hermes chose for the request.
"""
Claude Code OAuth bypass for hermes-agent.
==========================================

Monkey-patches hermes-agent's anthropic adapter so OAuth-authenticated
requests pass Anthropic's server-side billing validator and route to the
Claude Max/Pro subscription tier.

Tracks upstream ``griffinmartin/opencode-claude-auth`` (TypeScript) and
ports its bypass behaviors to Python.

Version history
---------------
- 1.7.0 (2026-08-18): Community PR integration sweep.  Fingerprint re-synced
  to upstream's current ``ccVersion`` 2.1.217 (was pinned at 2.1.112 while
  the real CLI shipped 2.1.234): system identity reverted to upstream's
  "You are Claude Code, ..." string (the "Claude Agent SDK" variant from
  PR #15 is now only *recognised* on input, never emitted), beta list aligned
  to upstream ``baseBetas`` (added interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14,
  thinking-token-count-2026-05-13, extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11; dropped the
  unconditional effort-2025-11-24, which upstream applies per-model), and the
  per-request ``x-client-request-id`` header added.  Merges PR #16/#20/#21/
  #23/#24/#26/#27/#28.
- 1.6.0 (2026-05-08): Wire-format changes for CC 2.1.117 parity — structured
  metadata (JSON-encoded device_id + account_uuid + session_id),
  X-Claude-Code-Session-Id header, context_management body field, Node v24.3.0
  stainless header, cache_control on system identity entry.  (Its system
  identity change was reverted in 1.7.0; see above.)
- 1.6.0 (2026-08-06): Bound the headerless-429 auto-wait loop.  A 429 whose
  body is ``{"type":"rate_limit_error","message":"Error"}`` and which carries
  no ``anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*`` headers is Anthropic's third-party
  *detection* response, not a quota — the request went out without the Claude
  Code identity.  Retrying it unchanged can never succeed, but the previous
  code fell back to ``HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_DEFAULT_S`` (300s) and looped
  forever.  Observed in production: one stuck ``delegate_task`` child emitted
  370 × 429 over 24h at exactly 5-minute spacing while its parent stayed
  blocked on ``result()``.  Headerless 429s now retry at most
  ``HERMES_RL_AUTOWAIT_HEADERLESS_ATTEMPTS`` (default 2) times before
  re-raising to Hermes core's normal give-up path.  429s that *do* carry
  reset headers (real quota) are unaffected.
- 1.5.7 (2026-05-30): Root cause fix: preserve original Anthropic content
  block interleaving order instead of stripping thinking blocks as a
  workaround.  Hermes core changes:
  (a) AnthropicTransport.normalize_response saves the raw content block
      array (with original order) in provider_data["_anthropic_raw_content"].
  (b) chat_completion_helpers forwards _anthropic_raw_content onto the
      assistant message dict.
  (c) _convert_assistant_message uses _anthropic_raw_content (fast path)
      to replay the original block order, making signed thinking blocks
      byte-identical to the API response — no more signature invalidation.
  (d) _strip_thinking_from_replay now skips messages with signed thinking
      blocks (i.e. those that went through the fast path), only stripping
      legacy messages where block order was lost.
  (e) error_classifier classifies "cannot be modified" as thinking_signature.
  (f) conversation_loop recovery strips reasoning_content alongside
      reasoning_details to prevent re-synthesis of unsigned thinking blocks.
- 1.5.6 (2026-05-30): Fix: _strip_thinking_from_replay now handles the edge
  case where ALL content blocks in an assistant message are thinking blocks.
  Previously the empty-list check `if stripped:` was False for `[]`, leaving
  the original signed thinking blocks intact and triggering the "cannot be
  modified" 400.  Also patched Hermes core error_classifier to classify the
  "cannot be modified" error as thinking_signature (it lacked "signature" in
  the message text), and conversation_loop recovery to strip reasoning_content
  alongside reasoning_details to prevent re-synthesis of unsigned thinking
  blocks on retry.
- 1.5.5 (2026-05-30): Fix: _strip_thinking_from_replay removes signed
  thinking/redacted_thinking blocks from ALL assistant messages before
  tool-name rewriting.  Hermes round-trips reorder thinking vs tool_use
  blocks, making Anthropic signature validation impossible — byte-identical
  replay cannot be achieved.  Strip thinking blocks pre-emptively (not via
  conversation_loop recovery which triggers the "cannot be modified" 400
  by mutating the latest assistant message).  The model still generates
  fresh thinking for the current turn.
- 1.5.4 (2026-05-30): REVERTED in 1.5.5.  The _has_thinking_block guard on
  _rewrite_tool_names was counter-productive: _rewrite_tool_names MUST
  restore tool names to their original mcp__hermes__ form for replay
  byte-identity; skipping the rewrite left names as mcp_<name> which
  differs from the original.
- 1.5.3 (2026-05-30): Fix: _split_tool_results_from_followup_user_text
  no longer strips thinking blocks from the assistant message during
  interrupted tool-turn repair.  The stripping triggered Anthropic's
  "thinking blocks cannot be modified" 400, and the standard recovery
  path (strip reasoning_details → retry) would hit the same error again
  because the bypass re-stripped on every retry.  The assistant is now
  preserved byte-for-byte; Hermes core's _manage_thinking_signatures
  handles non-latest-assistant thinking blocks on the next turn.
- 1.5.1 (2026-05-30): Classify Anthropic's newer "latest assistant thinking
  blocks cannot be modified" 400 as recoverable thinking replay failure.
- 1.5.0 (2026-05-06): Fix literal ``\\n`` escapes in system-reminder text,
  lowercase Stainless headers (matches upstream JS SDK), restore Opus 4.6
  temperature stripping, port ``repair_tool_pairs`` (upstream PR #136) and
  haiku effort stripping (upstream PR #126), lowercase tool names after
  unwrap to silence hermes auto-repair (intent of commit 6d9cade), patch
  ``normalize_response`` on both old and new hermes transports.
- 1.4.0-pr10 (2026-04-29): Hermes 0.11.0 ``AnthropicTransport`` support,
  ``mcp__hermes__`` namespacing, accountUuid → user_id metadata.
- 1.1.1 (2026-04-22): macOS Keychain mirror in installer (no module change).
- 1.1.0 (2026-04-22): PascalCase ``mcp_`` tools, ``sdk-cli`` entrypoint,
  ``advisor-tool-2026-03-01`` beta, Stainless headers, ``?beta=true``.
- 1.0.0 (2026-04-09): Billing header, system prompt relocation, prompt-
  caching beta, Opus 4.6 temperature hook.

# Subscription rate-limit auto-wait (Claude Pro/Max windows: 5h, 1d, 7d)
# ==================================================================
# When a long agent run exhausts a Claude Pro/Max usage window mid-flight,
# api.anthropic.com returns HTTP 429 (rate_limit_error) with a reset time in
# the ``retry-after`` and/or ``anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*-reset`` headers.
# Hermes core's retry loop caps backoff at 120s and gives up after
# ``_api_max_retries``, surfacing "rate-limiting requests" on Telegram and
# abandoning the run.
#
# This patch wraps the two API-call entry points on ``run_agent.AIAgent``
# (``_interruptible_api_call`` and ``_interruptible_streaming_api_call``) so a
# genuine subscription-window 429 instead SLEEPS until the window resets
# (interruptibly, in short chunks) and then retries the same call
# transparently — the give-up logic never runs.  Per-minute throttles (short
# resets) are slept through too.
#
# As of v1.5.9 the auto-wait is **window-aware**: Anthropic now reports which
# subscription window tripped via the unified
# ``anthropic-ratelimit-unified-{5h,1d,7d}-status`` / ``-reset`` headers.
